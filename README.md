# DM-Map-Selecting-Tool

## Project Title; D&D Map Finder

## Description of App;

D&D Map Finder is a tool for any Dungeon Master playing a table top role playing game. Often times the players of these games will find themselves in encounters that the Dungeon Master did not plan for. This app is to work as a tool for those DM's who are in need of a quick map to help set the encounter for their players. Also for quick reference for the DM there is a stat block that they can use that is going to detail the information for the creature or person that the players are fighting. This map will be rendered to the page and is completely random meaning that there is a chance for a completely different encounter each time.

The maps are divided into locations so the DM is able to narrow down the location for the encounter. This means that if the players are in a forest then the DM is able to get a map that has woodlands in it. This allows the story to stay consistent.

If the DM finds a map that they wish to use in the future then they can save to their local engine and to them upload it to the cloudinary server from the app. This map will then be used for future DMs to pull from.

Then next step in the app is going to be adding tokens for the number of npc's that are in the encounter. This will allow the DM to focus their attentence less on the map and encounter set up and more on the story of around their players.
